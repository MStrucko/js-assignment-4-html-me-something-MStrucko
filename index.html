         <h2>United States Army</h2>
         <p>
            When I discuss my "professional journey", I will typically gloss over everything prior to enlisting in the United States Army.  
            I had spent time in multiple restaurants and warehouses up until I was 21.  That is when I decided to make a change in my life 
            and join the United States Army in 2009.  I was first stationed in Fort Leonard Wood, MO for OSUT(One Station Unit Training), 
            where I trained to be a Combat Engineer.  Once OSUT was completed I was then stationed at Camp Casey, South Korea.  I continued my 
            active duty position at Camp Casey for two years.  Once my portion of active duty was completed in 2011, I came home and became part of the 
            United States Army Reserve and was stationed at Jefferson Barracks, MO.  My military contract was complted in 2014 and I can honestly say
            that my time in the military gave me the qualities I needed to begin a professional career in the civilian world.
